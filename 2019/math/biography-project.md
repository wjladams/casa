# Biography Project
In this project the student will pick a historical mathematician to present a biography on.
The main component of the biography is a presentation.

## Directions

1. Pick 3 mathematicians, and write 2 sentences about why you find them interesting.  Your biography will be on one of these 3 mathematicians.
2. Pick your mathematician for the biography.
3. Find 3 resources for information and turn in:
    1. Include URL's, author information, title for each resource (you will turn this into MLA format later).
    2. From *each* resource get 3 facts about your mathematician (this will be a total of nine unique facts).
    3. Create a document with this information.
4. Create a presentation for your mathematician, it must include:
    1. Their birth and death dates.
    2. Where did they live/work?
    3. What field(s) of mathematics did they contribute
    3. Who were their collaborators and contemporaries?
    4. Include at least one main theorem they are known for, or main result.
    4. Discuss an application of that mathematician's work.
    5. Bonus: Discuss scientific fields impacted by your mathematician.
    6. Your MLA references at the end.
    7. The presentation can be on slides.google.com or prezi.com 
    8. Follow Steve Jobs basic rules for a presentation.
