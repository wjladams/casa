# Project Ideas

1. Use [Geogebra geometry online tool](https://www.geogebra.org/geometry) to explore geometric concepts, for instance:
    * Comparing opposite angles of intersecting lines
    * The angles of a triangle
    * Parallel lines
    * The angles of a quadrilateral
    * etc.
2. Explore the turtle programming language at [Turtle Academy](https://www.turtleacademy.com/)
3. Use our **Javascript for Kids** textbook to find javascript programming projects to work on.
4. Do a mathematical art project.  This could be a music piece, sculpture, drawing, etc.  It must include:
    * Pick a mathematical topic the art work is going to speak to.
    * Create the piece of art.
    * Write a companion piece to discuss how the artwork speaks to the mathematical topic
5. Research [Conway's Game of Life](http://pmav.eu/stuff/javascript-game-of-life-v3.1.1/), problems include:
    * Finding and documenting stable patterns.
    * Looking at alternate rules and how that changes the patterns
    * Finding a way to program the basic rules in a language to adjust them more freely.
6. Exploring mathematics with the Python programming language.  See Bill for project ideas.
