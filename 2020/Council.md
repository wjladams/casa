# Adolescent Montessori Student Council

1. **Attendance**: role call for students, marking those here and not
2. **Reflection**: a quote or short reading that means something to the person running council.  Pause for a moment to think about it, and answer any questions people may have.
3. **Finance report**: whoever is managing the money, report how much money we have, what was spent in the previous week, and what came in.
4. **Managers reports**: each microeconomy section should have a student manager, they would report on progress this week, and any needs they have for the coming week.
5. **What went well this week**: during this past week, what went well that someone would like to call out.  This is not the same as "thank yous", in that you are not calling out a specific person.  For instance, if the physical expression went well, you would say so here.
6. **Problems this week**: what were the problems that were encountered this week.  This could be student to student interpersonal issues, issues with the running of classes, problems reaching teachers, etc.
7. **Thank yous**: any person you would like to call out to, for doing something you are grateful for this week.
