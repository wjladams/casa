# Element Project

1. Make a 3d model of your element
2. Give a presentation about your element

## 3d model

The details of this can be found in the [lab you needed to complete before making your model](https://github.com/wjladams/casa/blob/master/2020/science/Lab%203%20Neutrons%20and%20atomic%20model-2021Version.pdf).  The components that you need in the model are:

1. Nucleus (labeled)
2. Orbitals (labeled)
3. Electrons (at least one labeled)
4. Protons (at least one labeled)
5. Neutrons (at least one labeled)
6. The name of the element you modeled

## Presentation
1. State of matter it normally is found in
1. Boiling point, melting point, freezing point
1. How did we discover it.
1. Applications, include pictures and usage
1. What is its history
1. What group and period
1. How neutrons protons and electrons does it have
1. Describe its appearance (sample words, ductile, malleable, lustrous)
1. Is it a metal, metaliod, nonmetal
1. Are there useful isotopes?
1. How many valence electrons does it have?
1. Follow Steve Jobs rules for presentations
1. At least 3 MLA formatted references at the end of your presentation
1. Practice with a classmate
