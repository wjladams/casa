# Biography Project Redo
In this project the student will pick a historical mathematician to present a biography on.  This is for the second attempt at doing a biography.  It was
given because the students did not take the first version seriously.
The first versions is available at [here](../../2019/math/biography-project)

## Directions

1. Pick your mathematician for the biography.  You have already picked 3
mathematicians to research in the previous attempt, you may choose one of the other
2 or simply a new one.
2. Find 3 resources for information and turn in:
    1. Include URL's, author information, title for each resource (you will turn this into MLA format later).
    2. From *each* resource get 3 facts about your mathematician (this will be a total of nine unique facts).
    3. Create a document with this information.
4. Create a presentation for your mathematician, it must include:
    1. Their birth and death dates.
    2. Where did they live/work?
    3. What field(s) of mathematics did they contribute
    3. Who were their collaborators and contemporaries?
    3. For 8th graders, talk about a predecessor and successor.
    4. Include at least one main theorem they are known for, or main result.
 **You must understand the theorem well enough to explain it**.
    4. Discuss an application of that mathematician's work.
    5. Bonus: Discuss scientific fields impacted by your mathematician.
    6. Your MLA references at the end.
    7. The presentation can be on slides.google.com or prezi.com
    8. Follow Steve Jobs basic rules for a presentation.
5. You will present your presentation to the class and answer questions.
