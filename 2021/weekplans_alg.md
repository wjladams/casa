# Algebra week plans
In this file, we have a week by week overview of what was covered.  The assignments are not directly linked here, since they are elsewhere.

## Week 1
### Tuesday
Lesson/Discussion topics
* _What is mathematics?_ the science and art of finding and using patterns.
* [Bach organ fugue visualization of patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddbxFi3-UO4)
* Art of M.C. Escher
* Demonstration of projectile motion and parabolic paths
* Stump the chump, i.e. I claim that everything is mathematics, and they try to find something that is not mathematical.
* [Knock code exercises](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U06XcsFspu8KAN_23WcwOCW-9xS24IluFGwGOy32qQg/edit?usp=sharing)
* Time permitting work on Morse code as well.

### Thursday
* Finding patterns in the world around us.  If math is the study and use of patterns, and if everything is mathematical then we should be able to find patterns everywhere in the world.
* [Finding patterns exercises](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jFKtXioBGcuLrV7nrccva9nHKl5koOddg0Mj1-VoQ58/edit?usp=sharing)
* Time permitting introduce to fracts using [Xaos](https://xaos-project.github.io/)


## Week 10
### Tuesday
* Integer bingo 1st half of class
* Reviewing Pythagorean Theorem
* Solving equations, using subtraction and division, both one step and 2 step
* Did problems on:
  * Solving multiple xs
  * One step equations with division
### Thursday
* Inverse operations lesson, there are 2 main points to this lesson.  One is to simply know inverse operations.  However, the other is to help when solving equations, knowing which steps to do first.  The socks and shoes analogy.
* Solve Equations Showing Work
* Solve Equations Part 1
* Challenge Equations
